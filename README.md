Hii there, Myself Krupali Desai and I'm currently working on frontend development. 

###60-Days-Code
To improve my skills with projects I made "60-Days-Code". This is challenging for me as a begginer still I complete this 60 days challenge. 60-days-code is a grand challenge as a repository where I add  daily frontend projects for 60 consicutive days. As a coder, It is important to constantly practice and work with projects. For 2 months, I uploaded a new project to this repository, This giving me an opportunity to explore different patterns.   
At the end of 60 ndays, I have not only completed 60 unique projects, But also improved my frontend skills and through this projects I learnt to solve various types of errors and I gained valueable experience working on variety of different projects.Random Number Generator
