Hii there, Myself Krupali Desai and I'm currently working on frontend development. To improve my skills with projects I made "60-Days-Code". THis is challenging for me as a begginer still I complete this 60 days challenge. 60-days-code is a grand challenge as a repository where I add  daily frontend projects for 60 consicutive days. As a coder, It is important to constantly practice and work with projects. For 2 months, I uploaded a new project to this repository, This giving me an opportunity to explore different patterns.
