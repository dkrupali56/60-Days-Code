# 60-Days-Code


Welcome to the 60 Days Code Challenge!

This challenge is for anyone who wants to improve their coding skills and build something meaningful. Over the next 60 days, you will be challenged to build a frontend project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

Each day, you will work on your project for at least one hour and commit your progress to GitHub. This will not only help you track your progress but also allow others to see what you're working on and provide feedback.

Your project can be anything you want, as long as it's a frontend project that uses the technologies listed above. You can build a website, a web app, or even a mobile app using React Native.

By the end of the challenge, you will have a completed project that you can showcase in your portfolio and demonstrate your skills to potential employers.

So what are you waiting for? Join the 60 Days Code Challenge and take your coding skills to the next level!
